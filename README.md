## Why

That project is the second challenge from the course Go Stack from [Rocket Seat](https://github.com/Rocketseat). And I'm adding this project for my personal portifolio, so if you could let me any feedback I'd appreciate so much. Any comment that can make me a better programmer will be help a lot!

And for sure, you can use this Project as you wish!

It's free!
